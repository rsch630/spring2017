# Welcome to RSCH 630!
Spring Quarter 2017  

## Course Overview

It's not possible for graduate students to understand every research method available to them.  Therefore, students must develop the ablility to (1) recognize the structure of their data and (2) identify appropriate method(s) to achieve desired results from said data.

A research methods course is foundational for any graduate program to help students develop these skills. With that said, student's needs change with each offering - it's challenging to select which methods should be covered.  I've designed this course to (hopefully) bridge this gap by focusing on the research methods that will be of use in each of your specific research projects.

## Course Objectives

1. Expose students to many different research techniques and concepts related to scientific inquiry. 

2. Advance students along the research process by introducing the basic tools needed to critically analyze claims made through written and oral means, and determine the degree to which these claims are valid.

3. Help students conduct their own research and judge the validity of claims made in articles and newspapers, trade journals, academic journals, briefings, presentations, and professional discussions.

4. Give students a foundation for designing and conducting their own research projects and determine how close to the truth they have come in their own efforts

## Assessment -  your grade will be based on three deliverables

1. An in-class presentation of your thesis research

2. An expanded outline of your thesis document

3. A take-home final exam covering the research methods presented in class
